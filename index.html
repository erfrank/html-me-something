            <h2> Chicago, IL</h2>
            <img src= "https://www.homeland.cz/cache/e/a/5/c/8/ea5c8322d1cd720c3d78111fdc1f5120c2ca3ef5.jpeg" alt=" Chicago skyline">

                So there is no way I can make a list of cities that I love without starting with my beautiful home
                town. The first reason why I love Chicago is because of the great food! My favorite thing to eat back home is 
                The pizza! You have not had pizza until you have tried Homerun! It has a deliciously butter crust and the 
                sauce is absolute perfection! There are a number of other things to love about Chicago including
                the beautiful architecture, legendary sport teams, museums, and of course Navy Pier!

            <h2> San Francisco,CA </h2>
            <p>
                Next on my list is San Francisco. First my favorite thing about San Francisco is the weather.
                Some might find it unusal that I love the weather so much because it's kind of chilly year round with temps around 
                56, 65  maybe 75. San Francisco also has great seafood, views and things to do. Finally another great thing about San Francisco
                is that the city is socially progressive. If the cost of living wasn't made for trillionaires I would 
                move there tomorrow

            <h2> Orlando, Florida</h2>
            <p> 
                Last on my list is Orlando, Florida! Of course this city is great because it's in Florida 
                and Florida is awesome! Orlando is great specfically because it has all of the great food, boardwalks and entertainment that Miami has
                but at a lower price. Orlando is also the home of DISNEY WORLD!!!! So, yeah, Orlando is awesome.
